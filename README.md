Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring System using ESP8266, React, and Google Sheets
This project implements a real-time air quality monitoring system using the ESP8266 microcontroller, React for the frontend, and Google Sheets for data storage.

The ESP8266 collects air quality data from sensors and sends it to a backend server. The React-based frontend visualizes this data in real-time, while Google Sheets serves as a simple, scalable data storage solution for easy management and analysis.

The backend, built with Django, facilitates communication between the ESP8266 and Google Sheets. It processes incoming data from the ESP8266, stores it in the spreadsheet, and exposes APIs for data retrieval and manipulation.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdcc2a60-356e-46b3-aa30-88ef83b2e0e0)
